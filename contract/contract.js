     * Extending from Contract inherits its capabilities and allows you to define your own contract.
     * The contract supports the corresponding protocol. Both files come in pairs.
     *
     * Instances of this class run in contract context. The constructor is only called once on Peer
     * instantiation.
     *
     * Please avoid using the following in your contract functions:
     *
     * No try-catch
     * No throws
     * No random values
     * No http / api calls
     * No super complex, costly calculations
     * No massive storage of data.
     * Never, ever modify "this.op" or "this.value", only read from it and use safeClone to modify.
     * ... basically nothing that can lead to inconsistencies akin to Blockchain smart contracts.
     *
     * Running a contract on Trac gives you a lot of freedom, but it comes with additional responsibility.
     * Make sure to benchmark your contract performance before release.
     *
     * If you need to inject data from "outside", you can utilize the Feature class and create your own
     * oracles. Instances of Feature can be injected into the main Peer instance and enrich your contract.
     *
     * In the current version (Release 1), there is no inter-contract communication yet.
     * This means it's not suitable yet for token standards.
     * However, it's perfectly equipped for interoperability or standalone tasks.
     *
     * this.protocol: the peer's instance of the protocol managing contract concerns outside of its execution.
     * this.options: the option stack passed from Peer instance

    /**
     * A simple contract function without values (=no parameters).
     *
     * Contract functions must be registered through either "this.addFunction" or "this.addSchema"
     * or it won't execute upon transactions. "this.addFunction" does not sanitize values, so it should be handled with
     * care or be used when no payload is to be expected.
     *
     * Schema is recommended to sanitize incoming data from the transaction payload.
     * The type of payload data depends on your protocol.
     *
     * This particular function does not expect any payload, so it's fine to be just registered using "this.addFunction".
     *
     * However, as you can see below, what it does is checking if an entry for key "something" exists already.
     * With the very first tx executing it, it will return "null" (default value of this.get if no value found).
     * From the 2nd tx onwards, it will print the previously stored value "there is something".
     *
     * It is recommended to check for null existence before using put to avoid duplicate content.
     *
     * As a rule of thumb, all "this.put()" should go at the end of function execution to avoid code security issues.
     *
     * Putting data is atomic, should a Peer with a contract interrupt, the put won't be executed.
